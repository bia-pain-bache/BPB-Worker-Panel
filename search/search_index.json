Most are fine with the panel defaults, but these values may work better on your operator; you need to test: Length<pre><code>10-100\n</code></pre> Interval<pre><code>10-20  \n</code></pre></p> I extracted and used a Proxy IP regarding tutorials, why some sites or applications like X still won't work! <p>There are many public IPs and some of them might be unstable. You need to test to find a good one.  </p> It worked when I set a proxy IP, but now it's not working! <p>If you use a single IP, it may stop working after some time and many sites won\u2019t open. You need to redo the steps. Preferably, if you're not doing anything that needs a static IP, just use the panel default and don't use a single proxy IP.  </p> Why do I get an error when I go to the <code>panel/</code> address? <p>Follow the installation guide or use Wizard; KV, UUID or Trojan password are not properly configured.  </p> I deployed it but Cloudflare returns error 1101! <p>Your Cloudflare account has likely been flagged. Create a new Cloudflare account with an official email like Gmail and. Also, make sure the project name doesn't include the word \"bpb\". It is recommended to use Wizard for installation.  </p> Can I use this for trading? <p>If your Cloudflare IP is located in Germany (which it usually is), using a single Germany proxy IP should be fine. But preferably use the Chain Proxy method to stabilize the IP.  </p> Why I can't see non-TLS ports in panel? <p>To use non-TLS configs, you must deploy via Workers method and without a custom domain.  </p> Why doesn\u2019t the Best Fragment config connect or work properly? <p>Turn off <code>Prefer IPv6</code> in settings.  </p> Why don't Telegram calls or Clubhouse work? <p>Cloudflare can't properly handle the UDP traffic. There is currently no effective solution. Use Warp configs instead.  </p> Why won't ChatGPT open? <p>Because the panel's default proxy IPs are public and many might appear suspicious to ChatGPT. Use the link below to search and test an appropriate IP for yourself: <pre><code>https://www.nslookup.io/domains/bpb.yousef.isegaro.com/dns-records/\n</code></pre> Or enable the <code>Bypass ChatGPT</code> option in the routing section of the panel.  </p> I forgot the panel password. What should I do? <p>Go to your Cloudflare dashboard, find the KV created for Worker or Pages, click view, go to the KV Pairs section. In the table, you\u2019ll see a <code>pwd</code> key \u2014 the value next to it is your password.  </p> What happens if I don\u2019t change the UUID and Trojan password? <p>From version 2.7.7 onward, setting these two parameters is mandatory and the panel won\u2019t run without them.  </p> I used the Pages upload method but I get a 404. <p>Cloudflare takes about 4\u20135 minutes to register Pages domains. Give it time, refresh, and it should work.  </p> Why doesn\u2019t the panel show the Block Ads checkbox? <p>Extensions like <code>uBlock</code>, <code>AdGuard</code> or even some browsers with built-in ad-block settings, can hide it. Disable them for the panel.</p> Why wizard is detected as Virus in windows? <p>The wizard app lacks <code>Code signing certificate</code> and has to download worker.js on you PC, customize it and deploy to Cloudflare which is a suspicious behaviour to Anti Viruses, known as Trojan/Downloader. So you have to temporarily disable Windows defender or any other Anti Virus program.</p> Why v2rayN cannot ping test configs? <p>Right now v2rayN is experiencing some issues with custom configs and BPB panel configs are all custom. No worries, just enable config and use it.
