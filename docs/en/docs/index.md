## Features

3. **Versatile Protocols:** Provides VLESS, Trojan and Wireguard (Warp) protocols.
4. **Warp Pro configs:** Optimized Warp for crucial circumstances.
5. **Fragment support:** Supports Fragment functionality for crucial network situations.
6. **Comprehensive Routing Rules:** Bypassing Iran/China/Russia and LAN, Blocking QUIC, Porn, Ads, Malwares, Phishing and also bypassing sancitons.
7. **Chain Proxy:** Capable of adding a chain proxy to fix IP.
8. **Broad client compatibility:** Offers subscription links for Xray, Sing-box and Clash-Mihomo core clients.
9. **Password-protected panel:** Provides secure and private panel with password protection.
10. **Fully customizable:** Supports setting up clean IP-domains, Proxy IPs, DNS servers, choosing ports and protocols, Warp endpoints and more.

## Limitations

1. **UDP transport**: VLESS and Trojan protocols on workers do not handle **UDP** properly, so it is disabled by default (affecting features like Telegram video calls), UDP DNS is also unsupported. DoH is enabled by default for enhanced security.
2. **Request limit**: each worker supports 100K requests per day for VLESS and Trojan, suitable for 2-3 users. You can use custom personal domains to bypass limitation on VLESS/Trojan (Workers deployment) or opt for limitless Warp configurations.
