![Warp Pro subscription](../images/warp-pro-sub.jpg)

Recent advancements by the GFW-Knocker on Xray, Xray itself and Mihomo cores have enabled Warp unblocking, resulting in applications like **MahsaNG** and **v2rayN-PRO**. These developments optimize Warp connections for specific conditions in Iran, similar to efforts by the **Oblivion** team. The **Warp Pro** subscription has been added to the panel, with customizable settings.

Optimal values for each ISP are determined experimentally and may vary over time, like fragment settings. The default values are tested and currently effective; you only need to scan and set clean Endpoints.

You can download Warp Pro configs as a zip file for use in the **WG Tunnel** client. In the client, click `+` and import the zip file; no additional settings are required for the configs to connect. For **Amnezia**, the process is similar, but Amnezia does not import zip files correctly. Extract the zip file first, then import each desired config into Amnezia and connect.
