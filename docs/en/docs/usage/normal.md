# :material-playlist-check:{ .md .middle } Normal subscription

![Normal subscription](../images/normal-sub.jpg)

This subscription applies all optimal VLESS and Trojan settings, DNS servers, routing rules etc., minimizing user errors. It also includes a **Best Ping** config.

???+ question "What is the **Best Ping** config?"
    This config aggregates all panel configs and checks every 30 seconds to identify and connect to the fastest one. If you’ve added Clean IPs, enabled the Trojan protocol, or selected additional ports, these are included in the **Best Ping** config too. This feature is also available in Fragment and Warp subscriptions.

With routing settings applied, this subscription blocks approximately 90% of Iranian and foreign ads, bypasses Iranian, Chinese, and Russian websites (eliminating the need to disable the VPN for payment gateways), bypasses LAN, blocks porn and QUIC protocol, and for Sing-box and Clash subscriptions, effectively blocks phishing and malware content.
